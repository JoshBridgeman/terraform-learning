# TerraformLearning
This is me learning Terraform. The learning project deploys an EC2 instance with an nginx Docker image on it.

This involves:
1. Creating a custom VPC
2. Creating a subnet
3. Connecting an Internet Gateway and defining the Route Table to be associated with our subnet.
4. Security Group definition
5. SSH key pair creation
6. EC2 entry script including provisioning the container
